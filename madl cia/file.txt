Task 2: Build a Simple Login Form 
 Objective: Implement a Form with input fields and a button. 
Steps: 
1. Use a Form widget as the body. 
2. Inside the form, add two TextFormField widgets: one for "Email" and one for "Password". Set 
the obscureText property of the password field to true. 
3. Add an ElevatedButton at the bottom. 
4. When the button is pressed, use a print() statement to output "Login Button Pressed". 
Task 3: Implement a Row of Action Buttons 
 Objective: Use the Row widget for horizontal layout. 
Steps: 
1. Place a Row widget in the center of the screen. 
2. Inside the Row, add three IconButton widgets (e.g., for Call, Message, Email). 
3. Use the mainAxisAlignment property to space the buttons evenly. 
Task 4: Create a Page with Navigation 
 Objective: Implement basic navigation between two screens. 
Steps: 
1. Create two separate Dart files for two screens (e.g., home_screen.dart and profile_screen.dart). 
2. On the home screen, add an ElevatedButton. 
3. Use Navigator.push() inside the button's onPressed callback to navigate to the profile screen. 
4. On the profile screen, add an AppBar with a back button (automatically provided by Scaffold). 
Task 5: Add a Simple Fade-In Animation 
 Objective: Implement a basic implicit animation. 
Steps: 
1. Create a boolean variable _visible initialized to false. 
2. In the initState() method, use Future.delayed to set _visible to true after 1 second. 
3. In the build method, use an AnimatedOpacity widget. 
4. Set its opacity to _visible ? 1.0 : 0.0 and its duration to 1 second. 
5. The child of AnimatedOpacity can be any widget (e.g., a "Welcome" text). 
Task 6: Display a List of Items 
 Objective: Use a ListView to display scrollable content. 
Steps: 
1. Use a ListView.builder as the body. 
2. Define an itemCount (e.g., 10). 
3. In the itemBuilder, return a ListTile widget for each item. 
4. Set the title of the ListTile to "Item ${index + 1}". 
Task 7: Read and Display Data from a Local JSON String 
 Objective: Demonstrate basic JSON handling. 
Steps: 
1. Define a String variable containing a simple JSON array (e.g., '[{"name":"Apple"}, 
{"name":"Banana"}]'). 
2. Use json.decode() to parse the string into a list. 
3. Use a ListView.builder to display the list of fruits, displaying each name in a Text widget. 
Task 8: Implement a Bottom Navigation Bar 
 Objective: Create a multi-page app structure. 
Steps: 
1. Create a StatefulWidget. 
2. Define an int _currentIndex variable. 
3. In the Scaffold, add a BottomNavigationBar. 
4. Set the currentIndex property to _currentIndex. 
5. In the onTap callback, use setState() to update _currentIndex. 
6. Use a conditional statement in the body to display different containers/text based 
on _currentIndex. 
Task 9: Simple Widget Test for a Text Widget 
 Objective: Write a basic unit test for a widget. 
Steps: 
1. In the test folder, create a file widget_test.dart. 
2. Use the testWidgets function. 
3. Use pumpWidget() to build a MaterialApp containing a Text('Hello') widget. 
4. Use expect(find.text('Hello'), findsOneWidget) to verify the text is found on the screen. 
Task 10: Implement a Draggable Widget 
 Objective: Demonstrate understanding of the Draggable and DragTarget widgets. 
Steps: 
1. Create a Draggable widget (e.g., a colored Container with a "Drag me" text) as the child of 
a Center widget. 
2. Set the feedback of the Draggable to a slightly transparent version of the same container. 
3. Place a DragTarget widget elsewhere on the screen (e.g., in a Row or Column). 
4. In the DragTarget's onAccept callback, use setState() to change its color or child text to show 
the item was dropped. 
Task 11: Create an Image Gallery with GestureDetector 
 Objective: Use GestureDetector for a tap interaction on images. 
Steps: 
1. Use a Row or GridView to display 3 Image.network widgets (using free online placeholder 
image URLs). 
2. Wrap each Image widget in a GestureDetector. 
3. In the onTap callback of the GestureDetector, use a print() statement or a SnackBar to show a 
message like "Image 1 tapped". 
Task 12: Build a Simple Color Toggler 
 Objective: Manage a widget's state locally to change its appearance. 
 Short Steps: 
1. In a StatefulWidget, create a Color _backgroundColor = Colors.white; variable. 
2. In the Scaffold, set the backgroundColor to _backgroundColor. 
3. Add a FloatingActionButton to the screen. 
4. In 
the 
button's onPressed callback, 
use setState() to 
toggle _backgroundColor between Colors.white and Colors.blue. 
Task 13: Create an Animated Container 
 Objective: Implement an implicit animation that responds to user input. 
Steps: 
1. In a StatefulWidget, create a double _width = 100; and double _height = 100; variable. 
2. In the body, use an AnimatedContainer widget. Set its width, height, duration (e.g., 1 second), 
and color. 
3. Add a FloatingActionButton. 
4. In the button's onPressed, use setState() to change _width and _height to a new random or 
fixed size (e.g., 200). The container will animate to the new size. 
Task 14: Simple TabBar Layout 
 Objective: Implement navigation using a TabBar and TabBarView. 
 Short Steps: 
1. Create a DefaultTabController widget as the root of your app. 
2. Set the length property to 2. 
3. In the Scaffold, add an AppBar with a bottom property that is a TabBar with two tabs (e.g., 
"Chats", "Status"). 
4. Set the body of the Scaffold to a TabBarView with two children (e.g., a Center(child: 
Text("Chats Screen")) and Center(child: Text("Status Screen"))).
